- 👋 Hi everyone We are Mireia And Aitor, a couple of data scientist apprentices 
- 👀 We are interested in in any form of data science, but specially in data modelling and reporting
- 🌱 Aitor is currently learning modelling skills, specially forecasting and inner structure data models. Mireia is developing visualization, reporting and communication with data
- 💞️ We are looking to collaborate on projects that can be  useful for people and a bit challenging to keep sharping our skills every day ^^
- 📫 You can find us in data.mirai@gmail.com
